"""
Based on Kemp et al., 2012, I want to check the enrichment of each target codon (the codon corresponding to each of the 
tRNAs that were KOd in the library) in the beginning (5') area (30-50 first codons) of the CDS for each of the proteins
in S. cerevisiae. Because seemingly it's expected that those proteins which have a high concentration of the target 
codon at the beginning are subject to ribosomal queueing, which will prevent more ribosomes from joining and will 
strongly decrease the expression of the protein. In order for ribosomal queueing to happen we also need the mRNA to have
high initiation rates, so I should also keep that in mind.
